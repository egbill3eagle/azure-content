# About VPN Gateway settings

VPN Gateway is a collection of settings that are used to send network traffic between virtual networks and on-premises locations. You can also use VPN Gateway to send traffic between VNets within Azure. The sections in this article discuss settings that relate to VPN Gateway. 

Sometimes it helps to view the available configurations by using connection diagrams. You can find diagrams how to deploy each configuration in the [About VPN Gateway connections](vpn-gateway-topology.md) section of the article. 


## <a name="gwsku"></a>Gateway SKUs

When you create a VPN gateway, you need to specify the gateway SKU that you want to use. Gateway SKUs apply to both ExpressRoute and Vpn gateway types. Pricing does differ between gateway SKUs. For information about pricing, see [VPN Gateway Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/vpn-gateway/). For more information about ExpressRoute, see the [ExpressRoute Technical Overview](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md).

There are 3 VPN Gateway SKUs:

- Basic
- Standard
- HighPerformance

The following PowerShell example specifies the `-GatewaySku` as *Standard*.

	New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name vnetgw1 -ResourceGroupName testrg `
	-Location 'West US' -IpConfigurations $gwipconfig -GatewaySku Standard `
	-GatewayType Vpn -VpnType RouteBased


###  <a name="aggthroughput"></a>Estimated aggregate throughput by SKU and gateway type


The following table shows the gateway types and the estimated aggregate throughput. This table applies to both the Resource Manager and classic deployment models.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-table-gwtype-aggthroughput](../../includes/vpn-gateway-table-gwtype-aggtput-include.md)] 

## <a name="gwtype"></a>Gateway types

The gateway type specifies how the gateway connects and is a required configuration setting for the Resource Manager deployment model. Don't confuse gateway type with VPN type, which specifies the type of routing for your VPN. The available values for `-GatewayType` are: 

- Vpn
- ExpressRoute


This PowerShell example for the Resource Manager deployment model specifies the -GatewayType as *Vpn*. When you are creating a gateway, you must make sure that the gateway type is correct for your configuration. 

	New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name vnetgw1 -ResourceGroupName testrg `
	-Location 'West US' -IpConfigurations $gwipconfig -GatewayType Vpn `
	-VpnType RouteBased

## <a name="connectiontype"></a>Connection types

Each configuration requires a specific connection type. The available Resource Manager PowerShell values for `-ConnectionType` are:

- IPsec
- Vnet2Vnet
- ExpressRoute
- VPNClient

In the following PowerShell example, we create a S2S connection that requires the connection type "IPsec".

	New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name localtovon -ResourceGroupName testrg `
	-Location 'West US' -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $gateway1 -LocalNetworkGateway2 $local `
	-ConnectionType IPsec -RoutingWeight 10 -SharedKey 'abc123'


## <a name="vpntype"></a>VPN types

Each configuration requires a specific VPN type in order to work. When you create your configuration, you select the VPN type that is required for your connection. 

For example, if you want to connect to a VNet using both Site-to-Site (S2S) and Point-to-Site (P2S), you must use a VPN type that satisfies the connection requirements for both configurations. P2S connections require a route-based VPN type (dynamic routing gateway), while S2S connections can sometimes support a policy-based VPN type. This means if you already have a S2S connection that uses a policy-based VPN type (static routing), you must recreate the gateway using the route-based VPN type (dynamic routing) to support P2S.

There are two VPN types:

[AZURE.INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-vpntype](../../includes/vpn-gateway-vpntype-include.md)]



This PowerShell example for the Resource Manager deployment model specifies the `-VpnType` as *RouteBased*. When you are creating a gateway, you must make sure that the -VpnType is correct for your configuration. 

	New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name vnetgw1 -ResourceGroupName testrg `
	-Location 'West US' -IpConfigurations $gwipconfig `
	-GatewayType Vpn -VpnType RouteBased

## <a name="gwsub"></a>Gateway subnet

To configure a VPN gateway, you first need to create a gateway subnet for your VNet. The gateway subnet must be named *GatewaySubnet* to work properly. This name allows Azure to know that this subnet should be used for the gateway.<BR>If you are using the classic portal, the gateway subnet is automatically named *Gateway* in the portal interface. This is specific to viewing the gateway subnet in the classic portal only. In this case, the subnet is actually created with the value *GatewaySubnet* and can be viewed this way in the Azure portal and in PowerShell.

The minimum size of your gateway subnet depends entirely on the configuration that you want to create. Although it is possible to create a gateway subnet as small as /29, we recommend that you create a gateway subnet of /28 or larger (/28, /27, /26, etc.). 

Creating a larger gateway size prevents you from running up against gateway size limitations. For example, you may have created a virtual network gateway with a gateway subnet size /29 for a S2S connection. You now want to configure a S2S/ExpressRoute coexist configuration. That configuration requires a gateway subnet minimum size /28. To create your configuration, you would have to modify the gateway subnet to accommodate the minimum requirement for the connection, which is /28.

The following PowerShell example shows a gateway subnet named GatewaySubnet. You can see the CIDR notation specifies a /27, which allows for enough IP addresses for most configurations that currently exist.

	Add-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'GatewaySubnet' -AddressPrefix 10.0.3.0/27

>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] Verify that the gateway subnet does not have a Network Security Group (NSG) applied to it, as this may cause connections to fail.


## <a name="lng"></a>Local network gateways

The local network gateway typically refers to your on-premises location. In the classic deployment model, the local network gateway was referred to as a Local Site. You give the local network gateway a name, the public IP address of the on-premises VPN device, and specify the address prefixes that are located on the on-premises location. Azure looks at the destination address prefixes for network traffic, consults the configuration that you have specified for your local network gateway, and routes packets accordingly. 

Sometimes you need to modify the local network gateway settings. For example, when you add or modify the address range, or if the IP address of the VPN device changes. For a classic VNet, you can change these settings in the classic portal on the Local Networks page. For Resource Manager, see [Modify local network gateway settings using PowerShell](vpn-gateway-modify-local-network-gateway.md).
