# Microsoft Authenticator

The Microsoft Authenticator app provides an additional level of security that can be used in with either your Azure account (e.x. bsimon@contoso.onmicrosoft.com), your on-premises work account (e.x. bsimon@contoso.com), or your Microsoft account(e.x. bsimon@outlook.com).

## Download the Microsoft Authenticator app

The Microsoft Authenticator app is available for [Windows Phone](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825071), [Android](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825072), and [IOS](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825073).

## How the Microsoft Authenticator app works
The app works by pushing a notification to the Microsoft Authenticator app on your smartphone or tablet. You simply tap “Verify” in the app to authenticate. 

Alternately, the app can also be used with a verification code.  You simply enter the code provided by the app into the sign-in screen when prompted.

These 2 different modes are the following:

**Notification** - In this mode, the Microsoft Authenticator app prevents unauthorized access to accounts and stops fraudulent transactions. This is done using a push notification to your phone or registered device. Simply view the notification and if it is legitimate select Authenticate. Otherwise you may choose Deny or choose to deny and report the fraudulent notification. For information on reporting fraudulent notifications see How to use the Deny and Report Fraud Feature for Multi-Factor Authentication.

**One-Time Password** - In this mode, the Microsoft Authenticator app can be used as a software token to generate an OATH verification code. This verification code can then be entered along with the username and password to provide the second form of authentication.

## How to add an account using TouchID
The Microsoft Authenticator mobile app on iOS supports Touch ID.  Azure Multi-Factor Authentication allows organizations to require a PIN in addition to having possession of their registered device. With this new feature, iOS users with Touch ID-enabled devices won’t need to enter the PIN anymore. Once set up, users just scan their fingerprint instead of entering PIN and tapping Approve.

Setting up Touch ID with Microsoft Authenticator is really simple. You just complete a normal verification challenge with PIN, and if your device supports Touch ID, we’ll automatically set it up for you. 

![Touch ID](./media/multi-factor-authentication-azure-authenticator/touchid1.png)

From that point forward, when you are required to verify your sign-in, you tap on the push notification received and scan your fingerprint instead of entering your PIN.
